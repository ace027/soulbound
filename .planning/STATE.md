# Project State

## Current Position
- **Phase**: 1 of 4 (complete)
- **Status**: Phase 1 complete — review passed (2 cycles, 11 findings resolved)
- **Last Activity**: Phase 1 review passed (2026-09-17)

## Progress
```
[███████░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 38% — 6/16 plans complete
```

## Recent Decisions
- **Design source**: `.planning/explorations/2026-09-17-soulbound-artifact-to-app-design.md` (committed `7ec3ba2`)
- **Codebase map**: skipped — this session produced a more detailed structural map of the single legacy file than a generic indexer would, and that file is about to be deleted. Run `/legion:map` after the migration, against `frontend/` + `backend/` + `shared/`.
- **Scope**: full migration to playable, not a scaffold or vertical slice
- **Language**: TypeScript both sides; the World Voice contract lives in `shared/` so prompt/parser drift becomes a compile error
- **JSON contract**: structured outputs (`output_config.format`), field names unchanged
- **Models**: `claude-opus-5` on `callWorldEngine` + `generateIntroScene`, `claude-sonnet-5` on `determineUniqueSkill` — ⚠️ reverses a logged decision; `CLAUDE.md` and `design-decisions-log.md` must be updated in Phase 4 (R15)
- **Execution mode**: Autonomous — report at phase boundaries
- **Planning depth**: Standard — deep analysis already lives in the exploration doc
- **Cost profile**: Balanced — Opus 5 for the contract and the `App.tsx` game-logic port, Sonnet 5 for backend routes and UI extraction, Haiku 4.5 for verbatim data copying

## Next Action
Run `/legion:plan 2` to plan Phase 2: Backend & World Voice

## Phase 1 Plans
| Plan | Wave | Deliverable | Agent | Model | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | 1 | Repository reorganization & workspace root | Infrastructure & DevOps | Haiku 4.5 | ✅ |
| 02 | 2 | Shared contract package | orchestrator | Opus 5 | ✅ |
| 03 | 2 | Backend service skeleton | Backend Architect | Sonnet 5 | ✅ |
| 04 | 2 | Frontend service skeleton | Frontend Developer | Sonnet 5 | ✅ |
| 05 | 3 | Verbatim static-data extraction | general | Haiku 4.5 | ✅ |
| 06 | 3 | Compose wiring & end-to-end verification | orchestrator | Opus 5 | ✅ |

Planning-gate notes: architecture proposals and the spec pipeline were skipped — the committed exploration doc already carries the competing-approach analysis and serves as the spec. Plan critique was skipped for this phase (mechanical scaffold); run it before Phase 3, where the `App.tsx` game-logic port is the real regression risk. GitHub issue creation skipped — no `gh` CLI in this environment.


## Phase 1 findings carried into later phases
- **Legacy CSS drift** — the six duplicated `<style>` blocks were not identical. `breathe`, `glowPulse`, `etchIn` and the scrollbar thumb width differ between copies; each was resolved by plurality among existing legacy values. During the Phase 3 UI port, if a screen looks subtly off against the artifact, these four rules are the first place to look. There is no single "correct" original to diff against.
- **Seven keyframes, not six** — `cardHover` exists in legacy (as an empty block) and was missed by the plan's prose. Caught by diffing extracted lists.
- **Backend dev watch loop and frontend `dev` script are unexercised** — no plan's verify block covered them. Check manually when dev-loop iteration starts.
- **`runtime` frontend image has no route to the backend** — `serve -s` answers `/api/*` with 200 + index.html. Must gain a reverse proxy or a configurable API base URL before it is ever deployed. Dormant only while the frontend makes no API calls.
- **No auth or rate limiting on the backend** — ports now bind `127.0.0.1` as mitigation. Revisit when Phase 2's paid routes go live.
- **Docker builds need a trusted CA in this sandbox** — outbound HTTPS is TLS-intercepted. Handled via an optional BuildKit secret that no-ops elsewhere; set `NPM_CA_FILE` when building here.
